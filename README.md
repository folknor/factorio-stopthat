# Stop That, Silly Robot!

Disables personal roboports in your power/modular armor grid (and not in vehicle/train grids), when you are inside a vehicle, and its speed exceeds the configured value.
Bots that are already outside your roboports when they are disabled will return to you like normal.

Works fine with addons that add new levels/types of personal roboports. At least the one I tried, which I think was called "Personal Roboports", simply.

Configuring the speed value can be weird, but it's not something you really have to worry about unless you want to. Please make sure you read the tooltips for the two settings.

Works very nice in combination with my other addon, [Automated Fuel and Ammo](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/folk/folk-fill) and [Just Go!](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/folk-justgo). Please take a look at [my other addons](https://mods.factorio.com/user/folk) as well. I'm sure you'll love some of them :-)

## Problems?

If, for any reason (it has never happened to me except when I forcefully made it happen to test it) the mod does not replace your roboports when you dismount a vehicle, simply pick up the disabled roboports from your inventory and they will automagically turn into the roboport equipment type they replaced.

Please let me know about it, if you remember the details, and also include the names of the mods you are using.
