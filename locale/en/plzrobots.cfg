[mod-setting-description]
folk-stopthat-simply-in-vehicle=Enabling this option simply disables personal roboports while you are in a vehicle, unless the vehicle speed is literally zero.\n\nIf the setting is OFF (default), the mod disables your personal roboports when your vehicle speed exceeds the a percentage of researched worker speed, set below.
folk-stopthat-speed=Disable personal roboports when the vehicle you are in reaches this percent speed relative to your maximum researched worker speed (compared to vanilla bot speed, which start at 0.06).\n\nA value between 130%-180% seems to be the sweet spot for me, depending on vehicle type mostly.\n\nThe personal roboports are enabled again at the result of this percentage + 0.05.\n\nMinimum: 10%\nMaximum: 900%
